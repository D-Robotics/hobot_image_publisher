# hobot_image_publisher Topic Publishing Node

# Function Introduction
hobot_image_publisher achieves the publishing of image data and video data through configuring parameters.

1. Supports publishing images in local image formats jpeg/jpg/nv12/png. When publishing images, the message type is nv12.
2. Supports publishing videos in local video formats mp4/h264/h265. When publishing videos in h264/h265 format, the message type is the corresponding video format h264/h265.
   When publishing videos in mp4 format, hobot_image_publisher will extract the h264 video stream from the mp4 file before publishing, and the message type of the publication is h264.

# Compilation

## Dependencies

ROS packages:

- hbm_img_msgs
- img_msgs

hbm_img_msgs is a custom message format used to publish shared memory type image data, defined in hobot_msgs.
img_msgs is a custom message format used to publish ROS type video stream data, defined in hobot_msgs.

- If you need to specify image or video files using a list, please write img.list or video.list under config folder. Pay attention to the format of the list file: one file path per line.
- When using a list file, the file format in the list needs to be consistent with the parameter image_format. All images/videos in the list should have the same resolution, otherwise decoding will fail.
- When publishing nv12 images using a list file, the resolution of images in the list needs to be consistent with the input resolution.
- Can read specific format images/videos under a folder.
- When the file format is nv12, please input the original image resolution, or an error will occur.
- Currently supports a maximum frame rate of 15, exceeding this rate is not supported.
- When changing the image/video path, ensure that the parameter image_format matches the image/video format.
- When output_image_w and output_image_h parameters are set to 0 or not set, the image resolution will not be changed.
- When publishing videos, hobot_image_publisher will automatically obtain the resolution of the video, and does not support resolution changes, making the resolution configuration ineffective.
- When publishing images, the is_compressed_img_pub parameter is only effective when the image_format is jpeg/jpg/png.

## Running
- Execute with ros2 run (please replace image_source with your own file path)
  ```
  export COLCON_CURRENT_PREFIX=./install
  source ./install/local_setup.bash
  # config contains example image and video files, copy based on the actual installation path
  # For onboard compilation (without the --merge-install compilation option), the copy command is cp -r install/PKG_NAME/lib/PKG_NAME/config/, where PKG_NAME is the specific package name
  cp -r install/lib/hobot_image_publisher/config/ .
  ```
  Read all images in the folder with the jpg format and publish nv12 image data at a frequency of 5 frames per second
  ```
  ros2 run hobot_image_publisher hobot_image_pub --ros-args -p image_source:=./config -p fps:=5 -p output_image_w:=960 -p output_image_h:=544 -p image_format:=jpg -p source_image_w:=960 -p source_image_h:=544
  ```
  Read the ./config/test1.jpg image and publish jpg format image data
  ```
  ros2 run hobot_image_publisher hobot_image_pub --ros-args -p image_source:=./config/test1.jpg -p output_image_w:=960 -p output_image_h:=544 -p image_format:=jpg -p is_compressed_img_pub:=True
  ```
  Read the img.list file, get all jpg images paths listed in img.list, publish nv12 image data, frame rate at 5
  ```
  ros2 run hobot_image_publisher hobot_image_pub --ros-args -p image_source:=./config/img.list -p fps:=5 -p output_image_w:=960 -p output_image_h:=544 -p image_format:=jpg -p source_image_w:=960 -p source_image_h:=544
  ```
  Read the ./config/test1.jpg image and publish, with a frame rate of 5
  ```
  ros2 run hobot_image_publisher hobot_image_pub --ros-args -p image_source:=./config/test1.jpg -p fps:=5 -p output_image_w:=960 -p output_image_h:=544 -p image_format:=jpg -p source_image_w:=960 -p source_image_h:=544
  ```
  Read the video list file video.list, get all mp4 video file paths listed in video.list, and publish video topic with topic type as h264
  ```
  ros2 run hobot_image_publisher hobot_image_pub --ros-args -p image_source:=./config/video.list -p fps:=30 -p image_format:=mp4
  ```
  Read the video file test1.h264, video format is h264, and publish h264 video stream topic
  ```
  ros2 run hobot_image_publisher hobot_image_pub --ros-args -p image_source:=./config/test1.h264 -p fps:=30 -p image_format:=h264
  ```

- Execute with ros2 launch
  ```# The images and videos files used in config are provided as examples and should be copied according to the actual installation path
# If compiling for a board end (without the --merge-install compilation option), the copy command is cp -r install/PKG_NAME/lib/PKG_NAME/config/., where PKG_NAME is the specific package name
cp -r install/lib/hobot_image_publisher/config/.

```

1. Image publishing demonstration, which will start hobot_codec and websocket. The images will be displayed in the browser. Please input "IP address:8000" in the browser to view the effects. Refer to the following demonstration for the effect (for specific usage of websocket, please refer to hobot_websocket)
```
ros2 launch hobot_image_publisher hobot_image_publisher_demo.launch.py

2. Using the hobot_image_publisher node independently, this example reads nv12 format images and publishes the topic as /test_msg. Parameter settings can refer to this launch file
```
ros2 launch hobot_image_publisher hobot_image_publisher.launch.py

3. Video publishing demonstration, which will start hobot_codec and websocket. The videos will be displayed in the browser. Please input "IP address:8000" in the browser to view the effects (since the current X86 version of hobot_codec does not support decoding of h264/h265, this command only supports X3 batch version). Refer to the following demonstration for the effect (for specific usage of websocket, please refer to hobot_websocket). This example reads the video.list file and cyclically publishes videos with the topic as /hbmem_img. Parameter settings can refer to this launch file.
```
ros2 launch hobot_image_publisher hobot_image_publisher_videolist_demo.launch.py

4. Using the hobot_image_publisher node independently, this example reads h264 format images and publishes the topic as /test_h264. Parameter settings can refer to this launch file
```
ros2 launch hobot_image_publisher hobot_image_publisher_video_demo.launch.py
